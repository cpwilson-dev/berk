### Add

The `contents.md` file has been created, but as we saw it's untracked. We need to stage it (add it to the "index") with the `git add` command before committing it later.

Without staging, every file in the repository would be included in every commit, but that' often not what you want.

- Note: git add will autocomplete the file name...
