### Log

A Git repo is a (potentially very long) list of commits, where each commit represents the full state of the repository at a given point in time. The `git log` command shows a history of the commits in a repository. This is what makes Git a version control system. You can see:

- Who made a commit
- When the commit was made
- What was changed

Each commit has a unique identifier called a "commit hash". This is a long string of characters that uniquely identifies the commit.
